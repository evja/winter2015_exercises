## [ The Missing Link ]

## Description of Project

Please describe why you chose to present this project and what do you think it's the best or most accomplishing feature
I chose this project because the link aggregator type appealed to me for its challenges with routes and functionality

## Challenges
- What challenges did you encounter? How did you overcome them? Be candid.

showing all users links while disabling the functionality that only a user should have for their own, such as editing and deleting.
while keeping comments available from everyone. also adding the comment authors username as the default when they create a new link.

- Based on this project, what do you want to learn more of?
I would like to learn more about testing and making a project more secure.
also i would like to be able to incorporate the search function to be able to search the links by keyword.
